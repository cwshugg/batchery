# Windows Tools and Hacks
This is a repository I'm using to hold a few batch scripts I've made and registry hacks I've discovered. Batch scripts can be found inside `batch/`, and registry hacks can be found in `regs/`

## Sources
A great guide on useful registry hacks can be found [here](https://technicalustad.com/a-complete-guide-to-windows-10-registry-tweaks/).
